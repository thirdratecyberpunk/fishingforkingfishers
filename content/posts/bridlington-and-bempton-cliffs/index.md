It's been a little while since I've managed to go out and take some photographs, but this was a pretty nice way of getting back into the swing of it! Apparently the puffins were going to migrate a week after the trip, so I felt lucky to see them on the [Yorkshire Belle](https://yorkshire-belle.co.uk/rspb-seabird-cruises/).
