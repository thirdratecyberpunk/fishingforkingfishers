I can shut this blog down now - I managed to see a kingfisher and get a (not great) picture of it! I took my aunt's advice and went to [Woseley Centre](https://www.staffs-wildlife.org.uk/explore/our-visitor-centres/wolseley-centre) since she apparently has quite a lot of luck spotting them there. I barely managed to get a decent picture in the time between me spotting it (and freaking out) and it gliding away, but it was very exciting. I'm hoping to go again at some point and get a better shot since it's such a nice area.
