This blog is intended as a way of killing three birds with one stone (maybe not the best choice of analogy). During the lockdowns, I started to have an interest in bird photography - it was a great excuse to go out and explore nature when there was very little else to do and it was fun learning more about something I'd only casually noticed before. However, I'd mostly kept the pictures to myself and only occasionally shown them to people. I've also been meaning to mess around with Hugo and hosting a website on AWS. My hopes therefore are that a more public facing project like this will let me really try to experiment with my style and actually have an active side project which doesn't just end up sitting on my Github. My camera is a second hand [EOS 7D Mark II](https://www.canon.co.uk/for_home/product_finder/cameras/digital_slr/eos_7d_mark_ii/), which so far seems like a solid workhorse camera, although I can already feel myself straining to get a lens longer than 300mm. So far it's at a very amateur level and I definitely have a lot to learn about the process. Here are some of my favourite photos I've taken so far (you should be able to open the image in a new tab for a better look, I'm still tweaking the gallery shortcode):

I chose the name Fishing for Kingfishers partially because Birds on Film was already taken, partially as a shoutout to [King Gizzard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_for_Fishies) and partially because kingfishers are one of my favourite birds (in particular the [belted kingfisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belted_kingfisher)), in spite of the fact I can never seem to get a photo of them.
