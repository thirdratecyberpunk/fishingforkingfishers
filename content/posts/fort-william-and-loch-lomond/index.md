I spent some time in Fort William, not ten minutes away from where they filmed Braveheart. Sadly, there wasn't a chance to climb Ben Nevis this year, but I did manage to see some wildlife! Highlights I didn't manage to capture were tiny frogs, hooded crows and what sounded like a white tailed eagle (I'm terrible at recognising birds of prey though so I'd possibly take that with a pinch of salt). Also, while I'm happier with some of the motion shots I took, I need to practice so I can actually get a decent picture of swifts- unsurprisingly, they're quite quick.
