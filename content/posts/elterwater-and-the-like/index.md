One of my new year's resolutions is to post on this blog at least four times, so I figured I'd best start. I went on a trip to the Lake District and saw some pretty cool wildlife, including the [white-throated dipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-throated_dipper) which I had to crawl down from the cafe's balcony to actually get a picture of.
