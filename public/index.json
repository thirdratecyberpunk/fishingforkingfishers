Sadly, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a chance to climb Ben Nevis this year, but I did manage to see some wildlife! Highlights I didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to capture were tiny frogs, hooded crows and what sounded like a white tailed eagle (I\u0026rsquo;m terrible at recognising birds of prey though so I\u0026rsquo;d possibly take that with a pinch of salt). Also, while I\u0026rsquo;m happier with some of the motion shots I took, I need to practice so I can actually get a decent picture of swifts- unsurprisingly, they\u0026rsquo;re quite quick.\n","date":"1 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/fort-william-and-loch-lomond/","section":"Posts","summary":"I spent some time in Fort William, not ten minutes away from where they filmed Braveheart.","title":"Fort William and Loch Lomond!","type":"posts"},{"content":"I can shut this blog down now - I managed to see a kingfisher and get a (not great) picture of it! I took my aunt\u0026rsquo;s advice and went to Woseley Centre since she apparently has quite a lot of luck spotting them there. I barely managed to get a decent picture in the time between me spotting it (and freaking out) and it gliding away, but it was very exciting. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to go again at some point and get a better shot since it\u0026rsquo;s such a nice area.\n","date":"24 May 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/wolseley-centre-and-first-kingfisher/","section":"Posts","summary":"I can shut this blog down now - I managed to see a kingfisher and get a (not great) picture of it!","title":"Wolseley Centre and first Kingfisher!","type":"posts"},{"content":"In the tradition of any good blog, I have managed to let life get in the way of updating it.

During the lockdowns, I started to have an interest in bird photography - it was a great excuse to go out and explore nature when there was very little else to do and it was fun learning more about something I\u0026rsquo;d only casually noticed before. However, I\u0026rsquo;d mostly kept the pictures to myself and only occasionally shown them to people. I\u0026rsquo;ve also been meaning to mess around with Hugo and hosting a website on AWS. My hopes therefore are that a more public facing project like this will let me really try to experiment with my style and actually have an active side project which doesn\u0026rsquo;t just end up sitting on my Github. My camera is a second hand EOS 7D Mark II, which so far seems like a solid workhorse camera, although I can already feel myself straining to get a lens longer than 300mm. So far it\u0026rsquo;s at a very amateur level and I definitely have a lot to learn about the process. Here are some of my favourite photos I\u0026rsquo;ve taken so far (you should be able to open the image in a new tab for a better look, I\u0026rsquo;m still tweaking the gallery shortcode):\nI chose the name Fishing for Kingfishers partially because Birds on Film was already taken, partially as a shoutout to King Gizzard and partially because kingfishers are one of my favourite birds (in particular the belted kingfisher), in spite of the fact I can never seem to get a photo of them.\n","date":"17 May 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/hello-world/","section":"Posts","summary":"This blog is intended as a way of killing three birds with one stone (maybe not the best choice of analogy).","title":"Hello world!","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
