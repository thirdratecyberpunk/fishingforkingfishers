      <description>This blog is intended as a way of killing three birds with one stone (maybe not the best choice of analogy). During the lockdowns, I started to have an interest in bird photography - it was a great excuse to go out and explore nature when there was very little else to do and it was fun learning more about something I&amp;rsquo;d only casually noticed before. However, I&amp;rsquo;d mostly kept the pictures to myself and only occasionally shown them to people.</description>
